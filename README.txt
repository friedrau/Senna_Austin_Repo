Only start1.txt and goal1.txt work for this program.

the complexity of Graphmaker is O(N!)
making this a unworkable solution, I only discovered this wouldn't work right at the end when
I tested solutions 2 and 3. However solution 1 can be ran by all algorithms.

Senna_Titcomb_Austin_Friedrich_AIA1.exe is precompiled you only need to run it as demonstrated below.
there are output files from tests i've ran of every algorithm incase you want to look at my results.

Senna Titcomb used to be this projects partner but dropped the class before the assignments due date. 
This project is just representive of Austin Friedrich.


how to start program:
Windows machine:
cmd:
.\Senna_Titcomb_Austin_Friedrich_AIA1.exe .\start1.txt .\goal1.txt bfs test.txt

makefile Windows.
nmake -f Makefile.win
